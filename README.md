# Malaria-Detection-
Deep learning approach to solve malaria detection using transfer learning in Pytorch

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from this link <br>
<br>
<br>

## Dependencies
Pytorch (Version 1.0) <br>
<br>
You can download Pytorch from this link https://pytorch.org/ <br>

## Training

python malaria_detection_train.py 

You will get a saved model which we can use for prediction 

## Testing

python malaria_testing.py --img images/test1.jpg


## About the Model 

I have used resnet50 transfer learning architecture. I got an accurary of 97% on the validation set.
